# HackMIT-2021

## VolunteerU
VolunteerU was developed as part of the 2021 HackMIT hackathon.
The application was developed to connect students and faculty within universities for volunteer oppurtunities and to promote volunteer work. VolunteerU is a volunteer job board for students looking to volunteer with other students or members of their university community.

For this project some of the features that we developed include:
- Ability for volunteer job posters to login and register for an account
- Volunteer poster dashboard where all useful functionality is located
- Ability for volunteer seekers to scroll through volunteer postings and contact poster
